## Cathi Zi Portfolio

First Milestone Project - Code Institute. User Centricn Frontend Development

This is a small portfolio website created for my wife, who is a budding makeup artist. The portfolio consists of makeup examples, a bit about herself, services provided and contact form.

## Demo

Live demo of the website can be found [here](https://azigalovs.github.io/cathiziportfolio-1stmilestoneproject/)

## UX

The goal was to create a website with easy access to portfolio images and services provided, while maintainig minimalist design.

## Technologies

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Fontawesome (5.6.1) (4.7.0)

### Features 

Website uses embeded Instagram pictures, which allow users/visitors to go directly to the source of the image. 

## Features Left to Implement

I would potentially like to include carousel type imagery for Services provided. Along with incorporating videos of makeup being done or tutorials.

## Testing

Webpage was tested across multiple devices via DevTool option in Chrome. It has also been tested on multiple browsers for compatability and responsivness. 

## Deployment

This portfolio site is hoseted using GitHub Pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repositary. You can run it locally by cloning repositary directly by using git clone and using following URL https://azigalovs.github.io/cathiziportfolio-1stmilestoneproject/

## Credits

### Content

Content in "Meet Me" section was written by me, section "Services" was written with multitude of inspirational descriptions of various make up styles.

### Media

All background photose were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), stock image library. With the exception of images under "Some of My Work" and "Meet Me" sections, which are persona images of my wife.

### Acknowledgements

The idea for creating minimalistic, one page style website was taken from the Hayley Schafer portfolio example provided by Code Institute. Code for "Meet Me" and "Services" sections was also partially taken from the "Whiskey Drop" website created during one of the CSS modules. That code was modified to meet needs of this website.
